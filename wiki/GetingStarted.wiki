Unfortunately, due to [http://groups.google.com/group/android-developers/browse_thread/thread/3b252322deabc9d7?hl=en the component's usage of XML attributes and limitation of the 1.0 SDK] it isn't currently possible to distribute this component as a JAR.  _The XML attributes are to be removed soon until the SDK support is enhanced_.

For now you must follow these manual steps to get it installed:
  # Checkout the SlideShow component anonymously from the [http://android-slideshow.googlecode.com/svn/branches/releases/stable/0.6/android-slideshow 0.6 stable release of this project].  See http://code.google.com/p/android-slideshow/source/checkout for more about checking out files from this project.
    # Either check out the code directly into your project - or -
    # Copy the src/ directory from the files you checked out to your project.
  # Satisfy dependency on custom attribute in R.java (Android resources package).  Typically this means:
    # Add the "startIndex" attribute to your attrs.xml.
    # Build R.java (via Eclipse or Maven)
    # Re-import R.java into SlideShow.java.
