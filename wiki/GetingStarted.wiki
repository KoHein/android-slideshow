Unfortunately, due to [http://groups.google.com/group/android-developers/browse_thread/thread/3b252322deabc9d7?hl=en limitations of the 1.0 SDK] it is not possible to distribute this component as a JAR.  You must follow these manual steps to get it installed:
  # Checkout the SlideShow component anonymously from the [http://android-slideshow.googlecode.com/svn/branches/releases/stable/0.5/ 0.5 stable release of this project].  See http://code.google.com/p/android-slideshow/source/checkout for more about checking out files from this project.
  # Copy the src/ directory from the files you checked out to your project.
  # Delete the folder+files in src/com/freebeachler/android/demos/* *(you don't need the SlideShow Example)*.
  # [optional] Add an attribute in res/values/attrs.xml (or wherever your styleable resources are defined).  You only need to do this if you want to tweak the slideshow in your xml layout files.  Alternatively, you can tweak the slideshow in code.  A tutorial on using custom XML attributes can be found at http://blog.pocketjourney.com/2008/05/02/android-tutorial-42-passing-custom-variables-via-xml-resource-files/.
