= Introduction =

Masa (http://code.google.com/p/masa) is a maven plugin that enables maven builds of android projects.  The SlideShow example in this project comes with a pom.xml that requires the installation of masa to successfully build in maven.


= Details =

The primary motivation for masa in this project is to deploy junit tests to the emulator.  Unfortunately, this isn't currently exposed in the pom - but realizing this goal is next on the project roadmap.  It suffices to say the 0.5 release has gone through sufficient manual testing for general use.

= Instructions =

To build the SlideShowExample project and deply it to the emulator using masa:
  # Remove R.java from the project in the package com.freebeachler.android.component.slideshow.example.  It comes with the svn checkout and usually built automatically by Eclipse.
  # Build the project using masa.

For example, type:
{{{
mvn install -Dmasa.debug
}}}
